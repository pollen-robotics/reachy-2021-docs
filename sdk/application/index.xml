This project has been thought to:
be able to make Reachy move immediately after the robot setup, without having to do any code start to elaborate a way to define behaviors for human-robot interaction, making independant components that can be reused and integrated in more complex programs. The idea is to be able to integrate this idle mode in any project requiring such a state, without having to re-code this behavior again and again.</description></item><item><title>Face Tracking</title><link>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/sdk/application/face-tracking/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/sdk/application/face-tracking/</guid><description>What is this application The face tracking project is an autonomous application in which Reachy will detect faces in its field of view and track the detected face that is closet to it.
This can be used as is to make demo with the robot, show the capabilities of the Orbita actuator or serve as a brick to build more complex and interactive applications.
The source code can be found in the reachy-face-tracking GitHub repository.</description></item></channel></rss>
