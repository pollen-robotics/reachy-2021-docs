It is used to read sensor information (eg. force sensor, camera image or joint position) and send actuator commands (eg. target position, turning on a fan).
It is designed to:
let you start controlling your robot in a few lines of codes, allow to focus on your application and not on hardware synchronisation issues, facilitate fast prototyping and iteration.</description></item><item><title>Installation</title><link>https://pollen-robotics.github.io/reachy-2021-docs/sdk/getting-started/install/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pollen-robotics.github.io/reachy-2021-docs/sdk/getting-started/install/</guid><description>How to install the Python SDK The Python SDK is a pure Python library. The installation should thus be rather straightforward. It supports Python &amp;gt;= 3.6 (older versions may work but are not officially supported). It works on Windows/Mac/Linux.
We recommend to use virtual environment for your development. They make the installation simple and avoid compatibility issues. They also come with their pip command.
From PyPi pip install reachy-sdk From the source git clone https://github.</description></item><item><title>Finding Reachy's IP</title><link>https://pollen-robotics.github.io/reachy-2021-docs/sdk/getting-started/finding-ip/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Mar 2021 13:05:22 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pollen-robotics.github.io/reachy-2021-docs/sdk/getting-started/finding-ip/</guid><description>The last required step before actually programing your Reachy is to find its IP address.
Working directly on Reachy You can run the SDK directly on Reachy&amp;rsquo;s computer. In this case, the IP is the localhost address: &amp;lsquo;127.0.0.1&amp;rsquo;. You can thus directly use:
from reachy_sdk import ReachySDK reachy = ReachySDK(host='127.0.0.1') Using the SDK locally also avoids network potential latency or bandwidth issue. Yet, it may not be as conveninent as working directly from your usual laptop.</description></item><item><title>Hello World</title><link>https://pollen-robotics.github.io/reachy-2021-docs/sdk/getting-started/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Mar 2021 13:05:22 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://pollen-robotics.github.io/reachy-2021-docs/sdk/getting-started/hello-world/</guid><description>Now you should be able to connect to your Reachy and check that everything is ok. As we spoiled in the previous section, to connect to your robot, you simply need to run the following code:
from reachy_sdk import ReachySDK # Replace with the actual IP you've found. reachy = ReachySDK(host='the.reachy.ip.found.') Before diving into the next chapters that will guide you in the depth of what you can do with the Reachy SDK, here is a quick preview.</description></item></channel></rss>
