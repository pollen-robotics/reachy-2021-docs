from reachy_sdk import ReachySDK reachy = ReachySDK(host='192.168.0.42') # Replace with the actual IP The reachy object The reachy object instanciated above is the main tool to access the information coming from Reachy&amp;rsquo;s sensors (joints, force sensors, cameras) and to control each part of the robot (left/right arm, head).</description></item><item><title>Safety first</title><link>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/sdk/first-moves/safety/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/sdk/first-moves/safety/</guid><description>First, make sure that you followed the instructions from the section detailing how to attach your robot.
Especially, the screws in the Reachy&amp;rsquo;s back and the ones fixatings its metal support should be well tightened.
Turning on/off the motors If at anytime when you&amp;rsquo;re working with Reachy you feel that you&amp;rsquo;re losing control of the robot&amp;rsquo;s movements, don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to turn the motors off. Use the switch button placed in its back.</description></item><item><title>Controlling the arm</title><link>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/sdk/first-moves/arm/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/sdk/first-moves/arm/</guid><description>Make sure you checked the safety page before controlling the arm.
This section assumes that you went through the Hello World so that you know how to connect to the robot.
Arm presentation Reachy&amp;rsquo;s arm offers 7 degrees of freedom + 1 provided by the gripper and is composed of 8 joints.
The arm&amp;rsquo;s mechanical specifications are given here but as a reminder, the arm schematic is given below:
The joints Each joint has a unique name and uid.</description></item><item><title>Arms kinematics</title><link>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/sdk/first-moves/kinematics/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/sdk/first-moves/kinematics/</guid><description>Make sure you checked the safety page before controling the arm.
This page assumes that you went through the Hello World so that you know how to connect to the robot and that you also know how to use the goto() function presented in Controling the arm.
Arm coordinate system Joint coordinates If you remember the goto() function, to generate a trajectory for the requested joints you need to pass a dictionnary of joints with the requested position as the goal_positions argument.</description></item><item><title>Controlling the head</title><link>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/sdk/first-moves/head/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/sdk/first-moves/head/</guid><description>Make sure you checked the safety page before controling the arm.

Head presentation Reachy&amp;rsquo;s head is composed of three parts:
a front side where two cameras equipped with motorized zoom are attached, a back side equiped with two antennas to convey emotions along with two fans in the inner part to cool down the components inside the head, a neck ball joint, thanks to our Orbita actuator.</description></item><item><title>Reachy's cameras</title><link>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/sdk/first-moves/cameras/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/sdk/first-moves/cameras/</guid><description>This section assumes that you went through the Hello World so that you know how to connect to the robot.
Reachy 2021 has two high quality cameras which can deliver up to 1080p at 30 fps. Each camera is equipped with a motorized zoom allowing to adapt the zoom level to the situation you&amp;rsquo;re working on.
Each camera can be accessed separately with reachy.left_camera and reachy.right_camera.
First, connect to your Reachy.</description></item><item><title>Controlling the fans</title><link>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/sdk/first-moves/fans/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/sdk/first-moves/fans/</guid><description>This section assumes that you went through the Hello World so that you know how to connect to the robot.
Reachy is equipped with fans to cooldown the joints when they are working. Each arm has three fans, two fans are in the head and one fan is placed below orbita (Reachy&amp;rsquo;s neck).
First, connect to your Reachy.
