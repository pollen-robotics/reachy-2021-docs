## Prepare your robot for teleoperation

### If you want to teleoperate Reachy from the same network
If the computer used for the teleoperation app is connected to the same network as your robot, you only need to know your robot IP address.  
*Don't know the IP address? [Find out Reachy's IP]().*  

### If you want to teleoperate Reachy remotely


## How to start your application
Prepare your VR equipment to be VR ready: turn on all VR device, make sure they are correctly detected by SteamVR

For Oculus Quest users:
You need to launch the Oculus application before starting the teleoperation application. 

Launch the application .exe file

On your computer:
Connect to your Reachy IP: you need to add or select an IP address to connect to your Reachy robot directly on your computer

Equip yourself with your headset, make sure you can see both controllers and that the scene is moving correctly in accordance with your head movements.

Press A to enter the Menu
Choose the mode and view you want

Turn the motors stiff, then click “Validate my choices”

Choose the place you want to teleoperate Reachy from, position your hand in the posture you want to begin with.
Look straight ahead, with your body in the same orientation as your head. The initial head position is used to determine the coordinate system giving your VR controllers position.


Warning: you cannot move anymore after this step. The position of your VR controllers to master the robot arms are calculated depending on the position you had while clicking A.
