## Mode
**See Reachy:** The 3D-robot model is either:  
* fixed in a immovable position on its support in the basic scene
* not visible if you see Reachy view (2D or 3D View)  

**Be reachy:** set 3D-robot model as your own body  

**Use no headset:** deactivate the headset tracking so that Reachy’s head won’t follow your head movements  

## View
**2D View:** display Reachy’s left camera on a screen in the headset  

**3D View (experimental):** display Reachy’s stereoscopic view the headset

**Mirror view:** display mirrors in front of the 3D-robot model  

**Scene only:** basic scene (by default)

## Motors compliance
**Compliant:** set robot’s motors compliant, which means that they can be manually moved. Warning: you won’t be able to teleoperate Reachy with motors in compliant mode.  

**Stiff:** set robot’s motors stiff, which means that they cannot be manually moved anymore. Motors need to be in stiff mode to teleoperate Reachy.  

## Haptics on/off
