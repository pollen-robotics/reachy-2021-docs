## In brief

### Start teleoperating Reachy

1. Make sure the robot is turned on, connected to the network and that all the robot's services are running before launching the teleoperation application.

2. Enter your robot's IP address **on the computer** at the launch of the app.

3. Turn the motors **stiff** in the menu for the robot to be able to move.

4. After having clicked "Validate my choices", **look straight ahead, with your body in the same orientation as your head while pressing A.** *The initial head position is used to determine the coordinate system giving your VR controllers position.*

### Stop teleoperation
