## Full/Starter kit

Connect the power supply to the robot (g) placement on the [robot back interface]({{< ref "full-kit" >}}).  

Orbita neck needs to start in a straight position for its initialization. To do so, position the head so that Reachy looks straight ahead. (Don’t worry, the position doesn’t need to be exact, it just has to be correctly oriented).  

You have two buttons behind the robot:
- (a) : turn on/off Reachy’s embedded computer
- (h) : turn on/off alimentation of Reachy’s motors

Turn on button (h) before starting the robot using button (a).

| 1. Position the head so that Reachy looks straight ahead | 2. Switch on the motors | 3. Turn on the robot |
