## Full/Starter kit

The first thing to do before using your Reachy Full or Starter kit is to attach it safely.

There are two options to do that:
* **Using the metal bar included in Reachy's package**

Attach the metal bar to a table or a flat support using one of the metal fixation and screws:

If you don't want to drill holes in your table, you can also use clamps between the table and the bottom part of the metal bar. **However, make sure that the clamps make the attachment well tighten.**

Then attach the robot to the metal support rod using the other metal fixation:

*Note*: Do not forget to put the antennas on Reachyâ€™s head!

* **Putting Reachy on a moveable support**

You might prefer to have Reachy installed on a support that you can move easily instead of a table. For some applications like  [mask distribution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hk1BjEqp7-0), having a Reachy attached to a table takes space and was not really convenient for us. 

In replacement, we used a [rollable TV support](https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B074TB5MG5/) along with a custom [3D printed piece](https://forum.pollen-robotics.com/uploads/short-url/vuJ4zu7sYM7vmKyrdXXsRhPsoLP.stl) to attach the robot to it.
