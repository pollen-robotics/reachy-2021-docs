## What is the dashboard?

The dashboard is a page hosted by the robot to give you an overview of the state of the robot (which motors are detected, what services are running, what are the motors temperatures...) as well as giving you the possiblity to access quickly some features (setting back a part in compliant for example).  
This tool has been thought to help you start easier with the robot and facilitate quick debugging.
