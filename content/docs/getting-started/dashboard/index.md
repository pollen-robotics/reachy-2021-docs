## What is the dashboard?

The dashboard is a page hosted by the robot to give you an overview of the state of the robot (which motors are detected, what services are running, what are the motors temperatures...) as well as giving you the possiblity to access quickly some features (setting back a part in compliant for example).  
This tool has been thought to help you **start easier with the robot** and **facilitate quick debugging**.

## Access the dashboard

**From the robot:**  
Access the dashboard at `127.0.0.1:3972`

**From any other device on the same network as the robot:**  
Access the dashboard at `<robot-ip>:3972`

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="<b>First connection?</b> Connect your device to <b>Reachy-AP</b> network (password: Reachy-AP) and go to <b>10.42.0.1:3972</b>" >}}

## Features

You have 3 pages on the dashboard:
* Dashboard
* Services
* Network

### Dashboard

On this page, you can check the config of your robot.  

{{< img alt="Reachy detected configuration" src="dashboard.png" width="50%" >}}

The declared configuration is written and the bottom left. Based on this expected configuration, the dashboard displays the state if the parts which should be present.  

If everything is fine, you can also connect to the robot, and :
* have an overview of the motors' temperatures
* turn several parts stiff or compliant
* turn on or off the fans

### Services

Use this page to:
* check which services are currently running on the robot
* start and stop services
* display logs of the services

For each user service, you can see the status of the service (running or stopped), and access serveral buttons to start, stop and see the logs of the corresponding service:

### Wifi

The network page enables you to manage the networks known by the robot.  

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="If no network is known by the robot, it will automatically create an access point <b>Reachy-AP</b>" >}}

#### Reachy-AP

Reachy-AP is the access point automatically generated by the robot.  
It can be activated or deactivated from the network page:  
{{< img alt="Reachy's hotspot" src="wifi.png" width="50%" >}}

If no network is known by the robot, it will be automatically activated on start.

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="Password: <b>Reachy-AP</b>" >}}

On the access point, Reachy has a static IP: **10.42.0.1**
