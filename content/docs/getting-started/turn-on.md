## Get started

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="The Tutorial is intended for novice to intermediate users." >}}

Connect the power supply to the robot (g) placement on the [robot back interface]({{< ref "interface" >}}).  

Orbita neck needs to start in a straight position for its initialization. To do so, position the head so that Reachy looks straight ahead (see image x.x). (Donâ€™t worry, the position doesnâ€™t need to be exact, it just has to be correctly oriented).  

You have two buttons behind the robot:
- (a) : turn on/off Reachyâ€™s embedded computer
- (h) : turn on/off alimentation of Reachyâ€™s motors

Turn on button (h) before starting the robot using button (a).

| 1. Position the head so that Reachy looks straight ahead | 2. Switch on the motors | 3. Turn on the robot |
