## Hard-wired connection

**For Full/Starter kit only:**  

Use an **ethernet cable** to connect your robot to the network.
The ethernet plug is available at position (b) on [Reachyâ€™s hardware interface]({{< ref "full-kit" >}}).  
The computer inside Reachy is configured to use DHCP. It should thus be directly accessible on your network.
