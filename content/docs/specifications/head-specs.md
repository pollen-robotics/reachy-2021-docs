Reachy’s head features **two motorized high quality wide angle cameras**, to observe its environment as well as being able to focus on the task of manipulating. The head is animated by **Orbita**, a unique technology developed by Pollen Robotics’ R&D team. This ball joint actuator allows unpreceded dynamic and multi-directional movement. With **animated antennas**, Reachy can convey many emotions to his audience.

## Cameras
Dual 1080p@30fps camera with motorized zoom (FOV 65° to 125°), associated with 2 optical lenses

## Orbita neck joint
Ball joint actuator that is composed of a parallel mechanism motorized by 3 DC Maxon motors. The control of each motor is done with a magnetic absolute encoder included on the electronic board on top of Orbita.

## Antennas
Antennas are animated by a Dynamixel motor and are removable.  
A system of 3 magnets allow the attachment of the antennas to the rotation axis.
