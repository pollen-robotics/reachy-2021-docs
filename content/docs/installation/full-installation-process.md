You decided to buy a **Full/Starter kit**, congratulations! You just saved a lot of time ;)

Everything you need is already installed on your robot.

Of course you may want to know what's included in it. Please refer to section [What is running/What can I run on my robot]({{< ref "ROS2" >}}) for more information.
