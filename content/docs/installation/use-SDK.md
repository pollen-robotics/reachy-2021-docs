## Install Python SDK

If you want to control Reachy using its **Python SDK**, you only need to install it on the computer you want to use.  
The SDK is a pure Python library so it can be easily installed on any computer running **Python >= 3.6**.

You can install it with pip:
```bash
pip3 install reachy-sdk
```

See [https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy-sdk](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy-sdk) for more information.

**Ready to start using the Python SDK? Check out [Reachy Python SDK documentation](https://pollen-robotics.github.io/reachy-2021-docs/sdk/getting-started/introduction/)!**

## Useful: jupyter notebooks

If you want to use the examples from a remote computer, we advise you to install jupyter to use the notebooks:
```bash
pip3 install notebook
```
