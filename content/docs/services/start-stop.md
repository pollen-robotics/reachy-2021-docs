You can decide to start or stop at any time a service.  

If you start a service which is disabled, the service wonâ€™t be active anymore after you turn off the robot.  
If you stop a service which is enabled, the service will be active the next time you turn on the robot.  

To **start** a service:
```bash
sudo systemctl start <name_of_the_service>.service
```
To **restart** a service that was previously launched:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart <name_of_the_service>.service
```

To **stop** a service:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop <name_of_the_service>.service
```
