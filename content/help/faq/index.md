{{% expand "> Got '_InactiveRpcError' when I try to use ReachySDK from Python SDK. "%}}
It's very likely that you have a problem with reachy_sdk_server, the server running Reachy's software. Check the [Quick debug]({{< ref "help/debug" >}}) section.

{{% expand "> One of Reachy's motor red led is blinking" %}}
This means the motor has overheat and needs to cooldown. Turn the robot off, wait for it to cooldown and turn it on again.
{{% /expand %}}

{{% expand "> One of Reachy's module blue led is blinking" %}}
This means the module encounter an issue (safety shutdown, incorrect instruction, etc.). You need to turn the robot off and on again to restart the module. For more information on what the blue led means, check the [dedicated page]({{< ref "help/system/orbita-blue-led" >}}). 
{{% /expand %}}

{{% expand "> Reachy's head doesn't look straight when asked." %}}
You need to start the robot with the head in a position close to straight when starting the robot. Indeed, Orbita's position encoder only covers part of the whole motion range. We use this starting position to recalibrate the absolute position.

{{% expand "> Why can't Reachy's computer be turned on?" %}}
Check the page [Reachy's computer is not running]({{< ref "help/system/computer-not-running" >}}) explaining why you couldn't have Reachy's computer on.
{{% /expand %}}

{{% expand "> How can I view the camera feed?" %}}
- If the SDK server is running, check [Reachy's cameras]({{< ref "sdk/first-moves/cameras#video-stream" >}}) from the Python SDK documentation.

- If not, you will need to have a computer screen plugged to Reachy using an HDMI cable. 
To view the left camera, in a terminal in Reachy's computer:
```bash
python3 python3 ~/reachy_ws/src/reachy_controllers/examples/view_cam.py left open_cv
```
{{% /expand %}}

{{% expand "> The images from the cameras are blurry. "%}}
You can use the autofocus available in reachy-sdk.
For example, if you want to start the autofocus for the left camera, use:
```python
reachy.left_camera.start_autofocus()
```

If the autofocus did not work, you can learn how to perform the focus manually with [this page]({{< ref "help/system/manual-focus" >}}).

{{% expand "> Can I control Orbita's fan? "%}}
Orbita's fan is managed automatically based on temperatures limits set for Orbita in Reachy's software. You can't control it using Reachy's SDK.
{{% /expand %}}

{{% expand "> I connected a computer screen to Reachy, but I can't see any image." %}}
There might be a problem with the HDMI connection or Reachy's computer is actually not turned on. You can check the page [Reachy's computer is not running]({{< ref "help/system/computer-not-running" >}}).
{{% /expand %}}

{{% expand "> Where can I find examples on how to use the Edge TPU device? "%}}
Edge TPU Coral device uses the [pycroal](https://github.com/google-coral/pycoral) python library. We use this device everytime we need AI in one of our applications, for example to [classify objects for TicTacToe](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy-2019-tutorials/blob/master/custom_classifier/Tuto_classification.ipynb).

{{% expand "> Can you explain a bit Reachy's software?" %}}
Check the [Overall presentation]({{< ref "advanced/software/presentation" >}}) of the Software section.

{{% expand "> Does Reachy Mobile come with an autonomous navigation stack?" %}}
The current release does not come with an autonomous navigation stack. However, we have an internal (experimental) version where [nav2](https://navigation.ros.org/) runs. If this is of interest to you, please let us know.
