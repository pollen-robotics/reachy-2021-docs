## Access the dashboard

**From the robot:**  
Access the dashboard at `127.0.0.1:3972`

**From any other device on the same network as the robot:**  
Access the dashboard at `<robot-ip>:3972`


## Problem using the Python SDK

### Check the motors detected

On the dashboard page, the state of each expected parts of the robot is described. In case on of them is missing, the corresponding block displays the missing motors or elements.

### Check if the services are running

Go to the services page of the dashboard and check the status of the services.
