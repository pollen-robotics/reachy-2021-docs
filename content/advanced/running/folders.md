Reachy runs on **ROS 2 version Foxy**, which should now be installed and configured on your computer.  

You have 2 main folders that contain all the packages you need to control Reachy.

## *reachy_ws/src* folder
This folder contains all the ROS packages used with Reachy:  
* reachy_msgs: [https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy_msgs](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy_msgs)
