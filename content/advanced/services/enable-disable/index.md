By enabling or disabling a service, you make it start or not automatically when turning on the robot.  

If you enable a service, the service wonâ€™t be active until you reboot your robot or manually start the service.  
If you disable a service, the service will stay active until you reboot your robot or manually stop the service.  

To **enable** a service:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable <name_of_the_service>.service
```

To **disable** a service:
```bash
sudo systemctl disable <name_of_the_service>.service
```
