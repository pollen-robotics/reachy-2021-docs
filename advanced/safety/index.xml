We recommend that you move both Reachy&amp;rsquo;s arms with your hands before you start programming it. The goal is that you get a sense of Reachy&amp;rsquo;s working space, the positions it can reach so that you won&amp;rsquo;t get hit when you actually send it commands.</description></item><item><title>Use the mobile base properly</title><link>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/advanced/safety/mobile-base/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/advanced/safety/mobile-base/</guid><description>Basic mouvements We recommend that you get a feel for the inertia of the robot by holding on to the metal pole and pushing and pulling it.
Block a wheel with your foot and try to gently tilt the robot.
Then use the controller to move around the robot as explained in Moving the mobile base
Common risks and advice Even though the mobile base is programmed to move relatively slowly, it is important to try to avoid any potential collisions.</description></item></channel></rss>
