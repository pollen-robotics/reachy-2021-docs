It is useful when you just want to use our Python SDK without having to worry about running by hand Reachy&amp;rsquo;s core ROS code. Nevertheless, you may want to use Reachy differently and deactivate them.
We use system.d to handle the services. If you are not familiar with this system, you should refer to the official documentation.</description></item><item><title>Manage Reachy's services</title><link>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/advanced/services/manage-services/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/advanced/services/manage-services/</guid><description>The following commands are taken from systemd documentation. For more details, don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to check the documentation directly.
ðŸ’¡ If your Reachy has been produced before or not been upgraded since July 2022, for each command, replace the first part systemctl --user by sudo systemctl.
