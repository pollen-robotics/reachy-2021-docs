We recommend that you move both Reachy&amp;rsquo;s arms with your hands before you start programming it. The goal is that you get a sense of Reachy&amp;rsquo;s working space, the positions it can reach so that you won&amp;rsquo;t get hit when you actually send it commands.</description></item><item><title>Use VR teleoperation</title><link>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/help/safety/vr-use/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Mar 2021 13:05:22 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/help/safety/vr-use/</guid><description>Reachy doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the exact same degrees of freedom as you have, neither the same range for each joints. When a position cannot be reached, either because of the position or the orientation, the inverse kinematics gives the closest arm configuration found. The closest configuration found for the next position may be:
the same as the previous one, so the arm won&amp;rsquo;t move and you have the impression Reachy is not following your movements anymore quite different from the previous one, which will lead to sudden changes of the arm position All this contribute to give movements that seem incontrollable, due to discontinuities in the arm&amp;rsquo;s inverse kinematics.</description></item></channel></rss>
