This is just used to display the IP address of the robot on the network. It is useful when you want to connect to Reachy remotely without needing to plug a computer screen nor scanning the network to get its IP.
Hardware To display Reachy&amp;rsquo;s IP address, four components are needed:
LCD display Arduino Nano Every cables to solder between the LCD and the Arduino a micro USB cable to connect the Arduino to Reachy&amp;rsquo;s NUC.</description></item></channel></rss>
