The dashboard will allow you to setup your robot easily, without needing to plug a computer screen, mouse and keyboard.
Reachy&amp;rsquo;s hotspot When Reachy does not know any wifi network at boot, its hotspot is activated by default, meaning Reachy emits its own wifi. By default, the name of Reachy&amp;rsquo;s hotspot is Reachy-AP.</description></item></channel></rss>
