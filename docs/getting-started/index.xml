Orbita neck needs to start in a straight position for its initialization. To do so, position the head so that Reachy looks straight ahead. (Donâ€™t worry, the position doesnâ€™t need to be exact, it just has to be correctly oriented).
You have two buttons behind the robot:
(a) : turn on/off Reachyâ€™s embedded computer (h) : turn on/off alimentation of Reachyâ€™s motors Turn on button (h) before starting the robot using button (a).</description></item><item><title>Connect your robot to the network</title><link>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/docs/getting-started/network/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Oct 2020 15:21:01 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/docs/getting-started/network/</guid><description>Hard-wired connection For Full/Starter kit only:
Use an ethernet cable to connect your robot to the network. The ethernet plug is available at position (b) on Reachyâ€™s hardware interface.
The computer inside Reachy is configured to use DHCP. It should thus be directly accessible on your network.
WiFi For Full/Starter kit only:
Reachy is equipped with a Wi-Fi module! You can then directly connect Reachy to your network wirelessly.
Note: if you are connected to Reachy remotely and depending on your use, we advise to favor an ethernet connection to benefit from a more stable connection.</description></item><item><title>Connect to your robot</title><link>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/docs/getting-started/connect/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.pollen-robotics.com/docs/getting-started/connect/</guid><description>Connect to the embedded computer For Full/Starter kit only:
